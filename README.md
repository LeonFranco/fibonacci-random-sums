This is a project for learning C#.

## How it works
This project calculates random sums of Fibonacci numbers. The sequence of Fibonacci is the same for each algorithm and therefore should result in the same sum. This project times each algorithm to see how long each takes.

## How to run
```
dotnet run
```
